# SQL Enhanced Learning Template

This template provides a structure for SQL problems that promotes active learning and genuine skill development, adapted from our research-backed methodology.

## Core Principles for SQL Learning
1. **Active Schema Analysis**: Students examine table structures before writing queries
2. **Query Construction**: Step-by-step query building through guided discovery
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Exploring different approaches and trade-offs
4. **Performance Awareness**: Understanding efficiency and optimization
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Connecting SQL techniques across problems

## Template Structure for SQL Problems

### 1. Schema Understanding Section
```markdown
### 📊 Schema First (Active Analysis)
Before writing any SQL, spend 2-3 minutes analyzing the table structure:

**Schema Analysis Questions:**
1. [Question about table relationships and keys]
2. [Question about data types and constraints]
3. [Question about the business logic/domain]

*Take time to understand the data model before continuing...*

**Table Structure:**
```sql
-- Provided table schemas with sample data
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraints,
    column2 datatype constraints
);
```
```

### 2. Problem Statement (Standard)
```markdown
### Problem Statement
[Standard problem description]

**Example Input:**
```sql
-- Sample data
```

**Expected Output:**
```sql
-- Expected result set
```
```

### 3. SQL Prerequisites (Enhanced)
```markdown
### 📋 SQL Concepts Needed
- [Required SQL concepts]
- [Table operations needed]
- [Functions or clauses required]
```

### 4. Discovery Process (EDGE Method for SQL)
```markdown
### 💡 Query Construction (Guided Learning)

#### Step 1: [Data Understanding]
> **Guided Question:** [Question about what data we need to extract]

<details>
<summary>💭 Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

[Explanation of data requirements]
[Key insights about relationships or filtering needed]
</details>

#### Step 2: [Query Strategy]
> **Guided Question:** [Question about SQL approach or technique]

<details>
<summary>💭 Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

[Basic query approach explanation]
[Key SQL concepts being applied]
</details>

#### Step 3: [Optimization & Alternatives]
> **Guided Question:** [Question about improving the query or alternative approaches]

<details>
<summary>💭 Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

[Optimization explanation]
[Alternative solutions]
[Performance considerations]
</details>
```

### 5. Solutions Section (Enhanced with Multiple Approaches)
```markdown
### Solutions

#### Approach 1: [Basic Method]
```sql
-- Enhanced comments explaining the logic
-- Step-by-step breakdown of query construction
SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE ...
```

**Explanation:**
- [Why this approach works]
- [Key SQL concepts demonstrated]

#### Approach 2: [Alternative Method]
```sql
-- Different approach with trade-offs explanation
-- Performance or readability considerations
```

**Trade-offs:**
- [Performance comparison]
- [Readability differences]
- [When to use each approach]
```

### 6. Practice & Self-Assessment (SQL-Specific)
```markdown
### 🎯 Query Practice & Self-Assessment

#### Implementation Challenge
Try writing the query from memory:

**Step-by-step checklist:**
- [ ] [Identify main tables and joins needed]
- [ ] [Add appropriate WHERE conditions]
- [ ] [Include necessary aggregations or functions]
- [ ] [Add sorting or grouping clauses]
- [ ] [Test with edge cases]

#### Schema Variations
Practice adapting your solution:
- What if the table had different column names?
- How would you modify for additional constraints?
- Could you solve this with different SQL features?

#### Reflection Questions
After solving, think about:

1. **Query Logic:** Can you explain each part of your query in plain English?
2. **Performance:** What indexes would help this query run faster?
3. **Alternative Approaches:** What other SQL techniques could solve this?
4. **Pattern Recognition:** What similar problems use this technique?

#### Confidence Rating
Rate your confidence (1-5) on:
- [ ] Understanding the table relationships: ___/5
- [ ] Writing the basic query: ___/5  
- [ ] Optimizing for performance: ___/5
- [ ] Explaining the approach: ___/5

#### Next Steps
- If confidence is 3+ on all: Move to next problem
- If confidence is <3: Review the guided discovery section again
- Try the alternative approaches for deeper understanding
```

## Implementation Guidelines for SQL

### Do's:
- ✅ Always start with schema analysis
- ✅ Use guided questions that build query step-by-step
- ✅ Show multiple valid solutions when possible
- ✅ Include performance considerations
- ✅ Connect to broader SQL patterns
- ✅ Provide sample data for testing

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Give away complete queries immediately
- ❌ Skip the schema understanding phase
- ❌ Ignore performance implications
- ❌ Forget to explain the business logic
- ❌ Only show one solution approach

### Customization by SQL Category:

#### Basic Queries:
- Focus on SELECT fundamentals and WHERE conditions
- Emphasize data filtering and column selection
- Connect to real-world data scenarios

#### Joins:
- Emphasize table relationships and foreign keys
- Guide through join condition logic
- Show different join types and their effects

#### Aggregation:
- Focus on GROUP BY conceptual understanding
- Guide through aggregate function selection
- Emphasize HAVING vs WHERE differences

#### Window Functions:
- Build understanding of partitioning concepts
- Guide through frame specifications
- Connect to analytical use cases

#### Subqueries:
- Emphasize correlated vs non-correlated logic
- Guide through execution order understanding
- Show when subqueries vs joins are preferable

## Examples of Good SQL Guided Questions:

### Schema Analysis:
- "What relationships do you see between these tables?"
- "Which columns would you use to join these tables together?"
- "What business rule does this foreign key relationship represent?"

### Query Construction:
- "What's the first piece of data you need to extract?"
- "Which table contains the information you're looking for?"
- "How would you filter this data to match the requirements?"

### Optimization:
- "What would happen if this table had millions of rows?"
- "Which columns would benefit from having indexes?"
- "Is there a more efficient way to write this query?"

### Pattern Recognition:
- "What other problems have you seen that use this SQL technique?"
- "When would you choose a subquery over a join?"
- "How does this window function pattern apply to other analytical problems?"

## Success Metrics for SQL:
- Student can write correct queries from scratch
