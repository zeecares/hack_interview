## 1. Not Boring Movies (LC 620)

**ðŸ”— LeetCode Link:** [Not Boring Movies - LeetCode #620](https://leetcode.com/problems/not-boring-movies/)

### ðŸ“Š Schema First (Active Analysis)
Before writing any SQL, spend 2-3 minutes analyzing the table structure:

**Schema Analysis Questions:**
1. What makes a movie "boring" according to the schema?
2. How is movie rating stored and what might be a threshold?
3. What does the id column tell us about filtering criteria?

*Take time to understand the data model before continuing...*

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Click to see schema</summary>

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Cinema (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    movie VARCHAR(255),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    rating FLOAT
);

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO Cinema VALUES
(1, 'War', 'great 3D', 8.9),
(2, 'Science', 'fiction', 8.5),
(3, 'irish', 'boring', 6.2),
(4, 'Ice song', 'Fantasy', 8.6),
(5, 'House card', 'Interesting', 9.1);
```
</details>

### ðŸ’¡ Query Construction (Guided Learning)

#### Step 1: Understanding Multiple Conditions
> **Guided Question:** How do you filter rows based on multiple criteria simultaneously?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Multiple conditions require combining filters:
- **AND**: Both conditions must be true
- **OR**: Either condition can be true
- **Priority**: Use parentheses for complex logic

For "not boring" movies, we need:
- Description is NOT 'boring'
- AND rating above a certain threshold
- AND id is odd (based on problem requirements)
</details>

#### Step 2: Working with Text Comparisons
> **Guided Question:** How do you check if a text field does NOT contain a specific value?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Text comparison options:
- `!=` or `<>` for "not equal to"
- `NOT LIKE` for pattern matching
- `IS NOT NULL` for non-null values

For checking if description is not 'boring': `description != 'boring'`
</details>

#### Step 3: Checking for Odd Numbers
> **Guided Question:** How do you identify odd-numbered IDs in SQL?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Use the modulo operator:
- `MOD(id, 2) = 1` or `id % 2 = 1`
- Returns remainder when dividing by 2
- Odd numbers have remainder 1, even numbers have remainder 0
</details>

#### Step 4: Sorting Results
> **Guided Question:** How should movie results be ordered for better user experience?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Consider logical ordering:
- **By rating**: Highest rated first (`ORDER BY rating DESC`)
- **By movie name**: Alphabetical (`ORDER BY movie ASC`)
- **By ID**: Original order (`ORDER BY id ASC`)

Rating-based sorting makes most sense for movie recommendations.
</details>

### Solutions

#### Approach 1: Basic Filtering with Sorting
```sql
-- Find non-boring movies with good ratings
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE description != 'boring' 
  AND rating >= 8.0 
  AND MOD(id, 2) = 1
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
- Filters out movies with 'boring' description
- Keeps only movies with rating >= 8.0
- Includes only odd-numbered IDs
- Sorts by rating in descending order

#### Approach 2: Using Alternative Syntax
```sql
-- Alternative approach with different operators
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE description <> 'boring' 
  AND rating >= 8.0 
  AND id % 2 = 1
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

**Key Differences:**
- `<>` instead of `!=` (both work the same)
- `%` instead of `MOD()` (both work the same)
- Same logical structure and results

### ðŸŽ¯ Query Practice & Self-Assessment

#### Implementation Challenge
Try writing the query from memory:

**Step-by-step checklist:**
- [ ] SELECT all necessary columns
- [ ] Add WHERE clause with multiple conditions
- [ ] Use AND to combine conditions properly
- [ ] Include odd ID filter using modulo
- [ ] Add appropriate ORDER BY clause

#### Schema Variations
Practice adapting your solution:
- What if we wanted movies with rating >= 7.0?
- How would you find boring movies instead?
- What if we wanted even-numbered IDs?

#### Reflection Questions
After solving, think about:

1. **Condition Logic:** Can you explain why we use AND instead of OR?
2. **Performance:** Which condition might be most selective?
3. **Alternative Approaches:** Could you use CASE statements here?
4. **Pattern Recognition:** What other problems require multiple filters?

#### Confidence Rating
Rate your confidence (1-5) on:
- [ ] Writing WHERE clauses with multiple conditions: ___/5
- [ ] Using comparison operators for text: ___/5
- [ ] Working with modulo operator: ___/5
- [ ] Applying ORDER BY effectively: ___/5

## 2. Average Selling Price (LC 1251)

**ðŸ”— LeetCode Link:** [Average Selling Price - LeetCode #1251](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-selling-price/)

### ðŸ“Š Schema First (Active Analysis)

**Schema Analysis Questions:**
1. How are prices and units sold related across tables?
2. What does the date range in Prices table represent?
3. How do you calculate weighted averages?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Click to see schema</summary>

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Prices (
    product_id INT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    price INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id, start_date, end_date)
);

CREATE TABLE UnitsSold (
    product_id INT,
    purchase_date DATE,
    units INT
);

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO Prices VALUES
(1, '2019-02-17', '2019-02-28', 5),
(1, '2019-03-01', '2019-03-22', 20),
(2, '2019-02-01', '2019-02-20', 15),
(2, '2019-02-21', '2019-03-31', 30);

INSERT INTO UnitsSold VALUES
(1, '2019-02-25', 100),
(1, '2019-03-01', 15),
(2, '2019-02-10', 200),
(2, '2019-03-22', 30);
```
</details>

### ðŸ’¡ Query Construction (Guided Learning)

#### Step 1: Understanding Date Range Joins
> **Guided Question:** How do you join tables when one has date ranges and another has specific dates?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Date range joins require:
- JOIN condition on product_id (matching products)
- AND purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
- This ensures we get the right price for each sale date

Example: If someone bought product 1 on '2019-02-25', we need the price that was valid on that date.
</details>

#### Step 2: Calculating Weighted Averages
> **Guided Question:** How do you calculate average selling price when different quantities are sold at different prices?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Weighted average formula:
- Total Revenue = SUM(price Ã— units)
- Total Units = SUM(units)
- Average Price = Total Revenue Ã· Total Units

This gives more weight to sales with higher quantities, which is realistic for average selling price.
</details>

#### Step 3: Handling Products with No Sales
> **Guided Question:** What should happen to products that exist in Prices but have no sales?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Business logic consideration:
- **LEFT JOIN**: Include all products, even with no sales
- **INNER JOIN**: Only products with actual sales
- **COALESCE/ISNULL**: Handle null values appropriately

Typically, we'd use LEFT JOIN and return 0 or NULL for products with no sales.
</details>

### Solutions

#### Approach 1: Weighted Average with Date Range Join
```sql
-- Calculate average selling price per product
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    ROUND(
        COALESCE(
            SUM(p.price * u.units) / NULLIF(SUM(u.units), 0), 
            0
        ), 2
    ) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u 
    ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

**Explanation:**
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all products appear in results
- `BETWEEN` matches purchase dates to valid price periods
- `SUM(price * units)` calculates total revenue
- `SUM(units)` calculates total units sold
- `NULLIF` prevents division by zero
- `COALESCE` handles products with no sales
- `ROUND(..., 2)` formats to 2 decimal places

#### Approach 2: Simplified Version (Inner Join)
```sql
-- Only show products with actual sales
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    ROUND(SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 2) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
INNER JOIN UnitsSold u 
    ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Query Practice & Self-Assessment

#### Implementation Challenge
**Step-by-step checklist:**
- [ ] JOIN tables on both product_id and date range
- [ ] Calculate weighted average using SUM aggregations
- [ ] Handle division by zero scenarios
- [ ] Use appropriate JOIN type for business requirements
- [ ] Format results with proper rounding

INSERT INTO Employee VALUES
(1, 'Khaled', 3),
(2, 'Ali', 2),
(3, 'John', 1),
(4, 'Doe', 2);
```
</details>

### ðŸ’¡ Query Construction (Guided Learning)

#### Step 1: Understanding Project-Employee Relationships
> **Guided Question:** What information do you need to combine from both tables?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

We need to:
- Join Project and Employee tables on employee_id
- Group by project_id to get project-level statistics
- Calculate average experience_years for each project
- Include project_id in the final result
</details>

#### Step 2: Aggregation Strategy
> **Guided Question:** How do you calculate average experience per project?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Process:
1. JOIN to get project_id, employee_id, experience_years
2. GROUP BY project_id to aggregate per project
3. AVG(experience_years) to calculate average experience
4. ROUND to format the result appropriately
</details>

### Solutions

#### Approach 1: Basic Average Calculation
```sql
-- Calculate average experience years per project
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p
INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
```

**Explanation:**
- INNER JOIN connects projects with employee details
- GROUP BY project_id aggregates data per project
- AVG() calculates mean experience across project employees
- ROUND() formats to 2 decimal places for readability

#### Approach 2: With Additional Statistics
```sql
-- Include more project statistics
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    COUNT(p.employee_id) AS employee_count,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years,
    MIN(e.experience_years) AS min_experience,
    MAX(e.experience_years) AS max_experience
FROM Project p
INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id
ORDER BY p.project_id;
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Query Practice & Self-Assessment

#### Implementation Challenge
**Step-by-step checklist:**
- [ ] JOIN Project and Employee tables correctly
- [ ] GROUP BY project_id for aggregation
- [ ] Use AVG() function for experience calculation
- [ ] Apply ROUND() for proper formatting

**ðŸ”— LeetCode Link:** [Percentage of Users Attended a Contest - LeetCode #1633](https://leetcode.com/problems/percentage-of-users-attended-a-contest/)

### ðŸ“Š Schema First (Active Analysis)

**Schema Analysis Questions:**
1. How do you calculate participation percentage?
2. What's the relationship between total users and contest participants?
3. How do you handle percentage calculations and rounding?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Click to see schema</summary>

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_name VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Register (
    contest_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (contest_id, user_id)
);

-- Sample Data
INSERT INTO Users VALUES
(6, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob'), (7, 'Alex');

INSERT INTO Register VALUES
(215, 6), (209, 2), (208, 2), (210, 6), (208, 6), (209, 7), (209, 6), (215, 7), (208, 7), (210, 2), (207, 2), (210, 7);
```
</details>

### ðŸ’¡ Query Construction (Guided Learning)

#### Step 1: Understanding Percentage Calculation
> **Guided Question:** How do you calculate the percentage of users who attended each contest?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Percentage formula:
- Participants in contest Ã· Total users Ã— 100
- Need to count distinct participants per contest
- Need total count of all users
- Use subquery or JOIN to get both values
</details>

#### Step 2: Handling Division and Rounding
> **Guided Question:** What considerations are needed for percentage calculations in SQL?

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

Key considerations:
- **Data types**: Ensure floating-point division
- **Rounding**: Use ROUND() with appropriate decimal places
- **Null handling**: Consider what happens with 0 users
- **Performance**: Subquery vs JOIN for total count
</details>

### Solutions

#### Approach 1: Using Subquery for Total Count
```sql
-- Calculate participation percentage per contest
SELECT 
    contest_id,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100.0 / (
            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users
        ), 2
    ) AS percentage
FROM Register
GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC;
```

**Explanation:**
- `COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` counts unique participants per contest
- Subquery `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users)` gets total user count
- `* 100.0` converts to percentage and ensures float division
- `ROUND(..., 2)` formats to 2 decimal places
- `ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC` sorts by percentage then contest ID

#### Approach 2: Using Cross Join for Total Count
```sql
-- Alternative approach with cross join
SELECT 
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id) * 100.0 / total_users.user_count, 
        2
    ) AS percentage
FROM Register r
CROSS JOIN (SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_count FROM Users) total_users
GROUP BY r.contest_id, total_users.user_count
ORDER BY percentage DESC, r.contest_id ASC;
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Query Practice & Self-Assessment

#### Implementation Challenge
**Step-by-step checklist:**
- [ ] Count distinct participants per contest
- [ ] Get total number of users
- [ ] Calculate percentage with proper division
- [ ] Round to appropriate decimal places
- [ ] Sort results logically

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts Summary

### SQL Keywords Mastered
- `ORDER BY` - Sort results ascending/descending
- `GROUP BY` - Aggregate data by categories
- `HAVING` - Filter groups (vs WHERE for rows)
- `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()` - Aggregate functions
- `ROUND()` - Number formatting
- `DATE_FORMAT()` - Date formatting

### Aggregation Patterns
1. **Basic Grouping**: `GROUP BY column`
2. **Conditional Aggregation**: `SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN value ELSE 0 END)`
3. **Percentage Calculations**: `COUNT(*) * 100.0 / total`
4. **Weighted Averages**: `SUM(value * weight) / SUM(weight)`

### Best Practices
- Always use `ROUND()` for financial/percentage calculations
- Consider `DISTINCT` when counting unique items
- Use `HAVING` instead of `WHERE` for group-level filtering
- Handle division by zero with `NULLIF()` or `CASE`
