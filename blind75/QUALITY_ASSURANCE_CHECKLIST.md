## ðŸ“‹ Quality Standards Checklist

### Format Consistency âœ…
Each problem must include all these elements in order:

1. **ðŸ”— LeetCode Link** - Direct link to problem
2. **ðŸ¤” Think First (Active Retrieval)** - 3 reflection questions
3. **ðŸ’¡ Discovery Process (Guided Learning)** - 3 progressive steps with expandable details
4. **ðŸ“‹ Knowledge Prerequisites** - Required concepts (existing)
5. **Problem Statement** - Original problem description (existing)
