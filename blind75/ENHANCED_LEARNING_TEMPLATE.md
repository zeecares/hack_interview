# Enhanced Learning Template for Blind 75 Problems

Based on AI learning best practices, this template provides a structure that promotes active learning and genuine skill development.

## Core Principles
1. **Active Retrieval**: Students think before seeing solutions
2. **EDGE Method**: Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, Enhance
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed through guided discovery
4. **Self-Assessment**: Students monitor their own learning
5. **Human Effort**: Maintain mental engagement throughout

## Template Structure

### 1. Think First Section (Active Retrieval)
```markdown
### 🤔 Think First (Active Retrieval)
Before reading the solution, spend 2-3 minutes thinking about this problem:

**Quick Reflection Questions:**
1. [Problem-specific question about intuitive approach]
2. [Question about constraints or edge cases]
3. [Question about what information needs to be tracked]

*Take a moment to think through these questions before continuing...*
```

### 2. Problem Statement (Standard)
```markdown
### Problem Statement
[Standard problem description]

**Example:**
```
[Input/Output example]
```
```

### 3. Knowledge Prerequisites (Enhanced)
```markdown
### 📋 Knowledge Prerequisites
- [List of concepts needed]
- [Data structures required]
- [Algorithmic techniques]
```

### 4. Discovery Process (EDGE Method)
```markdown
### 💡 Discovery Process (Guided Learning)

#### Step 1: [Core Insight Question]
> **Guided Question:** [Question that leads to key insight]

<details>
<summary>💭 Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

[Explanation of the insight]
[Why this insight matters]
</details>

#### Step 2: [Naive Approach]
> **Guided Question:** [Question about basic approach]

<details>
<summary>💭 Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

[Basic solution explanation]
[Complexity analysis]
</details>

#### Step 3: [Optimization Discovery]
> **Guided Question:** [Question leading to optimization]

<details>
<summary>💭 Think about it, then click to reveal</summary>

[Optimization explanation]
[Data structure choices]
[Why this improves the solution]
</details>
```

### 5. Solutions Section (Standard + Enhanced Comments)
```markdown
### Solutions

#### Approach 1: [Basic Method]
```java
// Enhanced comments that explain the "why" not just "what"
// Include reasoning for each decision
```

#### Approach 2: [Optimized Method]
```java
// Comments that connect back to the discovery process
// Highlight the key insights being applied
```
```

### 6. Practice & Self-Assessment
```markdown
### 🎯 Practice & Self-Assessment

#### Implementation Challenge
Try implementing the optimal solution from memory:

**Step-by-step checklist:**
- [ ] [Key implementation step 1]
- [ ] [Key implementation step 2]
- [ ] [Key implementation step 3]

#### Reflection Questions
After solving, think about:

1. **Understanding Check:** [Question to verify comprehension]
2. **Complexity Analysis:** [Question about time/space complexity]
3. **Trade-offs:** [Question about design decisions]
4. **Pattern Recognition:** [Question connecting to other problems]

#### Confidence Rating
Rate your confidence (1-5) on:
- [ ] Understanding the problem: ___/5
- [ ] Implementing brute force: ___/5  
- [ ] Implementing optimal solution: ___/5
- [ ] Explaining the approach: ___/5

#### Next Steps
- If confidence is 3+ on all: Move to next problem
- If confidence is <3: Review the guided discovery section again
- Consider trying the follow-up questions for deeper understanding
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Do's:
- ✅ Use guided questions that lead to discovery
- ✅ Hide solutions behind expandable sections
- ✅ Connect each step to previous insights
- ✅ Include reflection and self-assessment
- ✅ Provide implementation checklists
- ✅ Use emojis for visual organization

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Give away solutions immediately
- ❌ Skip the thinking/reflection time
- ❌ Make questions too easy or obvious
- ❌ Forget to connect to broader patterns
- ❌ Overwhelm with too many questions

### Customization by Problem Type:

#### Array Problems:
- Focus on index management, iteration patterns
- Emphasize space/time trade-offs
- Connect to complement/two-pointer patterns

#### Tree Problems:
- Emphasize recursive thinking
- Guide through base cases and recursive relationships
- Connect to traversal patterns

#### Dynamic Programming:
- Focus on subproblem identification
- Guide through state definition
- Emphasize bottom-up vs top-down thinking

#### Graph Problems:
- Emphasize representation choices
- Guide through traversal strategies
- Connect to cycle detection patterns

## Examples of Good Guided Questions:

### Discovery Questions:
- "What information do you need to keep track of as you process each element?"
- "If you could only make one pass through the data, what would you need to remember?"
- "What's the relationship between the current element and elements you've already seen?"

### Optimization Questions:
- "What operation are you doing repeatedly that could be made faster?"
- "What information are you calculating multiple times?"
- "How could a different data structure help here?"

### Pattern Recognition Questions:
- "What other problems have you seen that use this technique?"
- "How does this approach generalize to similar problems?"
- "What's the key insight that makes this efficient?"

## Success Metrics:
- Student can implement solution after guided discovery
- Student can explain the approach in their own words
- Student recognizes when to apply similar patterns
- Student demonstrates increased confidence through self-assessment
